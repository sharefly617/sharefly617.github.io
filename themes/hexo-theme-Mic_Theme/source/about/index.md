-  Participating the project Spatio-temporal Double Non-stationary Channel State Information Aquisition for Massive MIMO System, A probabilistic structured channel model is proposed, which combins Hidden Markov Model and variational inference to consider noise, As the number of users and the number of elements in the set of statistical channel states increase, degradation,or statistical ambiguity, may occur. The problem is modeled as a semidefinite programming problem with nonconvex rank constraints and solved using a low-rank decomposition-based approach.
- Consider a more practical and complex scenario, i.e., a channel system with dynamic birth and death evolution in the propagation path, neither has any priori information about statistical channel state. A infinite state statistical channel model based on explicit duration hidden semi-Markov model and hierarchical Dirichlet process is proposed. As well as a Weak-Limit Gibbs sampling inference method based full Bayesian nonparametric inference is proposed to achieve statistical channel state estimation without any priori information in non-stationary massive MIMO system.
